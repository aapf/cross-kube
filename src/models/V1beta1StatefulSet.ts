 * DEPRECATED - This group version of StatefulSet is deprecated by apps/v1beta2/StatefulSet. See the release notes for more information. StatefulSet represents a set of pods with consistent identities. Identities are defined as:  - Network: A single stable DNS and hostname.  - Storage: As many VolumeClaims as requested. The StatefulSet guarantees that a given network identity will always map to the same storage identity.
